<p><em>Slow Autumn At My Window</em> is a new double album by Adrian Lane , written and recorded as a reflection on the ephemeral nature of life prior to the new normal of COVID-19.</p>
<p>“There was a period in my life before COVID where I became very aware of making good use of my time and I felt very driven to create music,” says Adrian. “I originally thought I would write 10 or 12 pieces, but found myself working on more and more. Every time I finished a track I had another idea I wanted to explore and started to write again.”</p>
<p>A painter by profession, Adrian often works on music and paintings simultaneously. You can see more of his work at his <a href="https://adrianlane.weebly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adrian Lane: Art &amp; Music</a> page.</p>

<h3><em><a href="https://preservedsound.bandcamp.com/album/invisible" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Invisible</a></em> is an album of original pieces written and recorded as blind collaborations in lockdown by 11 Preserved Sound artists.</h3>

<figure class="post__image post__image--right"><a href="https://preservedsound.bandcamp.com/album/invisible" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy"  src="http://preservedsound.com/media/posts/71/Invisible_Cover.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400"></figure></a></p>
<p><em><a href="https://preservedsound.bandcamp.com/album/invisible" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Invisible</a></em> is an album of original pieces written and recorded as blind collaborations in lockdown as a response to the COVID-19 crisis by 11 Preserved Sound artists across Europe, North America and Australia: Aaron Martin, Adrian Lane, Ales Tsurko, Benjamin Louis Brody, Cédric Dind-Lavoie, Glacis, Neal Heppleston, Tess Said So, Thomas Méreur, Trigg &amp; Gusset and Visionary Hours. The album was mastered by Ian Hawgood.</p>
<p>Each artist recorded a basic track. This was sent to three different artists, who recorded overdubs without hearing what the other artists had recorded. The overdubs were then sent back to the original artist to mix the finished piece.</p>
<p>The title <em>Invisible</em> not only refers to the concept that the COVID virus can’t be seen, but also that contributing artists collaborated on the pieces blindly without hearing what another artist had recorded or without having ever met. The album showcases the combined response of Preserved Sound’s community of artists to COVID-19 – with the individual pieces coalescing to create a cohesive whole.</p>
<p class="align-left">All proceeds of the sale of <em>Invisible</em> will go to support children affected by COVID-19 across the developing world via the charity <a href="https://www.marysmeals.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mary’s Meals</a>. The album costs £7.95 – this is the price Mary’s Meals is able to feed a child for half a year. With the UK government doubling donations until January 31, 2021, each album sale will essentially feed a child in the developing world for an entire year.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://vimeo.com/479596890" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cover was painted by Adrian Lane</a>, who writes: "The piece is very much inspired by the work of Mark Rothko, and was a homage to him created specifically for <em>Invisible</em>. The basic idea of rectangular forms and limited colour range are taken from Rothko but the application of paint, and use of mixed media is very much my own. The painting is built up from many layers of mixed media, with collage elements, a variety of different types of paint and acrylic texture gels. Producing the painting specifically for the album cover meant that I could try something different to what I usually do; and the use of colour particularly is very different to my usual work. The central shapes could be seen as an ‘=’ sign, and turned on its side becomes a ‘pause’ symbol, which is pretty appropriate for the times we are living in."</p>

Now, living between Nuuk and Krakow, GBTP bring you their very own form of ambient intergalactic indie rock.<br><br>The debut eponymous album by Grace Beneath the Pines takes influences from the raw, methodical emotion of bands such as Codeine, The For Carnation and Slint, fused with the lyrical lightness of Low and Piano Magic. Written with three different formations using three different bass players, each adding their own personality, skill, love and passion to the writing process, <em>Grace Beneath the Pines</em> is a musical journey that takes the listener to different places (musically speaking) through an amalgamation of musical styles and rhythms.</p>

Using piano and electronics, “Snow” is full of textures, clocking in at over ten minutes, and sets up the rest of the EP beautifully. A fast, staccato piano line slowly builds, with piano chords and electronics, falling into ambient noise; only for the piano line to re-emerge. “Sea” is a much more modern-classical melody, gentle, and leads the way to a more robust “Sky”. The album comes as a pressed CD, in a handmade, recycled card sleeve and insert, hand stamped and numbered on the back, and limited to 150 copies.</p>

<p><strong><em>This album is now sold out</em></strong><br><br>3+ is the project of Masashi Shiraishi from Ishikari City, Japan. Masashi is influenced immensely by Yukio Nakagawa, and deals with environmental sounds and ambient music with the essence of nature and beauty in order to create his own abstract language and sceneries. 3+'s music is not music, but the art of sound.</p>

<p>Combining the simplicity of Satie-esque piano and layered, Sigur Rós-style voices, Thomas Méreur’s debut album Dyrhólaey is about bringing his memories of the landscapes he saw on a recent trip to Iceland back to life.</p>
<p>“I wanted Dyrhólaey to be very simple, so it's mostly about piano and voice,” says Thomas. “Blending the voices together to create a whole new melody that enriches the sound was very exciting and rewarding to record.”</p>
<p>Named after Dyrhólaey, a small peninsula on the south coast of Iceland, Thomas has always felt a connection to the country through the music of artists such as Sigur Rós, Ólafur Arnalds, and of course Björk. There are, in fact, two themes that blend in this album – Iceland and losing someone – with some of the lyrics also making reference to this wild nature and strange comforting loneliness that seems to come from it.</p>
<p><a href="https://preservedsound.bandcamp.com/album/dyrholaey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dyrhólaey</a> is Thomas Méreur’s first album on Preserved Sound. </p>

<p>Tess Said So deliberately set out to do something very different with their second album, <em>Scramble + Fate</em>. Unlike their debut album, <em>I Did That Tomorrow</em>, Rasa and Will wrote the tracks together in the same room at the same time; improvising, exploring, innovating, jamming, tweaking, feeding off each other’s ideas and looking for just the right combination, just the right sound. Sometimes searching for that perfect combination involved hours frantically exploring every instrument available in every combination (“Scramble”). Other times, they were grateful for the happy accidents that improvisation can bring (“Fate”).</p>
<p><em>I Did That Tomorrow</em> is a collection of pieces about initiation and reaction, travel and stillness, simplicity and mutation. The sound world of piano, percussion and electronics, engineered at Will Larsen’s Recliner Studios in Melbourne, shifts through organic, improvisatory, imperfect patterns, playing with the idea of movement in light, space, and liquid, usually resolving – though not necessarily tonally – for a sense of agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Tess Said So</strong> is unique. The repertoire for piano and percussion is all but non-existent, but rather than see that as a limitation, Tess Said So thrives. Built on a longstanding friendship, the duo of <a target="_self" href="http://www.tesssaidso.com/#!rasa-daukus/ckp9"><strong>Rasa Daukus</strong></a> (piano, electronics) and <a target="_self" href="http://www.tesssaidso.com/#!will-larsen/c8mu"><strong>Will Larsen</strong></a> (drums, percussion) wanted to take up the challenge, knowing the possibilities were endless and unexplored. Their music is not a jazz/pop trio missing a bass player; their music is of its own, individual and in defiance of conformity, genre, format and convention.</p>
